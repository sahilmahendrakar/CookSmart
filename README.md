# CookSmart
Have ingredients but don't know what to cook? Enter CookSmart! Get recipes based on your ingredients! The user inputs ingredients they have and the program compares those ingredients to a database of recipes. If the user is missing less than 3 ingredients, the program will notify the user of recipes they can make.
